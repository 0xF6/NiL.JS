## Known bugs

**Async**

Execution of function in two or more threads gives incorrect result. To fix it, need to write "eval();" in any part of method body (e.g. after "return;"). But, better way to avoid this is to create functions dynamically for each thread using eval or Function("some code").

## If you found bug

... then you can choose one of three paths:  
  **1.** Ignore it. Maybe, sometime, somebody finds it too and tell me about it.  
  **2.** Create [bug report](https://github.com/nilproject/NiL.JS/issues). It's will take some time, but reduce time for fixing it.  
  **3.** Fork project and fix bug by yourself, after that create pull request.  

I hope that you will not choose the first path.
